# Home Loan Calculator

This is my first attempt at coding, wish me luck!

I've started this project with the intention of building a one-stop shop home loan calculator. I found myself frustrated having to search the internet for different tools to find out how much I needed to start the home ownership journey. So here I am, dabbling in JavaScript, HTML and a touch of CSS to bring to life the calculator I was looking for.
