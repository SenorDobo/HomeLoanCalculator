                                            Stamp Duty is a tax charged by the government on the purchase of a property.
                                            It's calculated based on the value of the property and varies by state or
                                            territory.
                                            You can expect this to be your biggest upfront purchase cost, and
                                            unfortunately cannot be included in your home loan amount.

                                            A building inspection is a thorough examination of a property's condition,
                                            focusing on the structural and safety aspects. It helps identify any
                                            potential issues with the property.<br><br>
                                            An estimated range for building inspections is $250 to $600 depending on
                                            complexity and location. Many building inspectors will also offer pest
                                            inspection as part of their service for an additional fee. This is often
                                            cheaper than getting building and pest inspections performed by different
                                            businesses.

                                            These are regular fees you'll need to pay for services like local government
                                            rates, water usage and waste services. This does not include your regular
                                            on-going bills like electricity and gas. When you buy a property, council
                                            and water rates are split between you and the seller based on how long each
                                            of you owns the home during the current billing period. Your conveyancer
                                            adjusts this at settlement. So if the seller has already paid for the
                                            quarter, you’ll reimburse them for your share. For example, if settlement is
                                            halfway through the quarter, you’ll pay them back for the remaining
                                            half.<br><br>

                                            An estimated range for council and water rates is between $1,500 and $2,500.
                                            This can vary significantly based on location, property value and
                                            level of coverage.

                            to protect themselves in case you can’t repay your loan. This is usually required if your
                            deposit is less than 20% of the property value. The exact values will depend on your lender
                            (bank).
